Mothership assistant is currently in beta and available at https://mothership-assistant-canary.wandering-mushroom.com/. It should be useable as is. The plan is to improve the UI and review the various data tables before publishing a stable branch to a new url. The canary url will remain available and will track a more up to date & unstable version of the code.

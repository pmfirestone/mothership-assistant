Mothership assistant is currently in beta and temporarily available for limited personal use at https://glamorous-quarter.surge.sh/. It should be useable as is. The plan is to improve the UI and review the various data tables before publishing a stable branch to a new url.

This is a fork of the original, from https://github.com/sbergot/mothership-assistant. I decided to publish my own version of this for my own players.
